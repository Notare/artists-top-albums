# Top Albums Finder (Work in Progress)

This project is a work in progress web application that allows users to search for an artist's top albums using the Last.fm API. It displays information about the artist's top albums, including album covers, play counts, and tracklists. Users can toggle the display of the tracklist for each album.

Please note that this project is currently under development, and new features and improvements are being actively worked on. Stay tuned for updates!
