## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A mobile-first approach was adopted, ensuring that the application provides a seamless experience on a variety of devices. The user interface is designed for simplicity and accessibility. Users can search for their favorite artist, triggering a fetch request to the Last.fm API. This fetch operation retrieves the artist's top albums, which are then presented on the page ordered by number of listeners, showing the album cover, album name, and a convenient button to reveal the tracklist. Hover effects were thoughtfully incorporated to enhance accessibility for users.

## Optimizations

During the project's development, an important optimization was realized. Artists can have an extensive discography, potentially leading to excessive scrolling for users. To address this, a "Back to Top" button was introduced, enabling users to effortlessly return to the top of the page, enhancing overall user experience.

## Lessons Learned:

Developing Top Albums Finder was an awesome learning experience. A significant focus was placed on API integration, understanding how to make effective API requests, and handle the resulting responses. This expertise was pivotal in connecting the application to external data sources. Dynamic DOM manipulation played a key role in creating interactive features and responding to user interactions. These aspects of the project provided valuable insights and a deeper understanding of how web applications can integrate with external data and engage users effectively.
